M2-CC3301 Overview
--------------------

The SimpleLink |trade| CC3301 Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth |reg| Low Energy devices enable affordable, reliable and secure connectivity in embedded applications with a processor host running Linux |reg| or an MCU host running RTOS. The CC3301 M.2 card plug-in module (M2-CC3301) is a test and development board that can be easily connected to TI processor boards or other processor boards with an M.2 Key E interface support; thus enabling rapid software development.

This document is intended to serve as a hardware user's guide to explain the various hardware configurations and features of the M2-CC3301.  The `CC33XX Radio Tool User's Guide`_ explains how to configure the hardware for use with Radio Tool for RF evaluation.

M2-CC3301 Hardware Features
----------------------------
The figures below show the features on the Top and Bottom side of the M2-CC3301 Add-in Card features, some of the features highlighted are described below:

    :align: center

    :alt: M2-CC3301_Features

    M2-CC3301 Features 

* The mounted 0 Ohm resistor can be swapped to a different position to do conducted testing with the connector on board (J1/J2), the default configuration allows use of the onboard chip antenna.
* The board provides a Test Point (LOG) to use the logger output from the device (UART TX debug logger).
* There is footprint for an SMA connector (J2) onboard to replace the onboard UF.L connector (J1) for performing conducted testing measurements with a compatible coaxial cable (refer to :numref:`M2-CC3301_Hardware_MoreFeatures` ).
* There is an optional placement for a 32.768 kHz oscillator (Y2). The CC3301 has an internal Slow Clock, but the slow clock can be generated externally by an oscillator (Y2) for optimal power consumption.
* The optional 2 pin header (J3) can access or provide the 3.3V power source and the board's ground.
* The M2-CC3301 Gold finger Edge connector (J5) follows the PCIE M.2 form factor Type 2230 Key E, as such the board can be compatible with any host that has a 75-position host interface connector for type key E.  Refer to :ref:`Signal Assignment` for more information on the pin out.

    :align: center
    :scale: 80
    :alt: M2-CC3301_MoreFeatures

    M2-CC3301 More Features

* The onboard LDO (U2) is used to derive 1.8V from the provided 3.3V.
* There is an onboard Level Shifter (U3) to receive only 1.8V for the nRESET Net signal (Active Low).
* Important to note that the "Dual Inverter Buffer with Open-Drain Output" (U4) allows the device to output the interrupt lines (Active Low) and conform to the PCI Express M.2 Specification. Since the component is Open-Drain the host platform must have a 10k pull up, pads have been provided to add the resistor (R11 for IRQ_WL, and R12 for IRQ_BLE) in case that is not true.
* There are resistors to optionally change the pin used for the "HOST_nRESET" and "IRQ_WL_toHost" Net signals (refer to :ref:`Signal Assignment` ).

.. _M2CC33X Clocks:

M2-CC3301 Clocks
-----------------

The M2-CC3301 is designed for two clock inputs (see :ref:`M2-CC3301_Hardware_Features` ):

* The Y1 is a 40 MHz crystal for fast clock input
* The optional Y2 is for a 32.768 kHz oscillator for slow clock input

 Since the CC3301 already has an internal Slow Clock it is optional to populate the component (Y2). The tradeoff of populating an externally generated oscillator (Y2) is optimal power consumption.

Performing Conducted Testing on M2-CC3301
----------------------------------------------

As seen in the :ref:`M2-CC3301_Hardware_Features`, the EVM has an onboard UF.L connector and chip antenna. The UF.L connector (J1) provides a way for performing conducted testing measurements. Alternately, footprint for an SMA connector (J2) is provided onboard to replace the UF.L connector (J1) and provide a way to test in the lab using a compatible cable. 

Rework will be needed before using the connector (J1/J2) for conducted testing. This involves swapping the position of the existing 0 Ohm resistor to lead the transmission line to the desired connection, see Figure below.
