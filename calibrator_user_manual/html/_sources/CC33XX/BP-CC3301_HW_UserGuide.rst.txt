CC3301 BoosterPack Hardware User's Guide
******************************************

Overview
=========
The SimpleLink |trade| CC3301 Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth |reg| Low Energy devices enable affordable, reliable and secure connectivity in embedded applications with a processor host running Linux or an MCU host running RTOS. The CC3301 BoosterPack |trade| plug-in module (BP-CC3301) is a test and development board that can be easily connected to TI LaunchPads or processor boards; thus enabling rapid software development. This document is intended to serve as a hardware user's guide to explain the various hardware configurations and features of the BP-CC3301.  The `CC33XX Radio Tool User's Guide`_ explains how to configure the hardware for use with Radio Tool for RF evaluation. Figure below shows an image of the CC3301 BoosterPack |trade| Rev. E3.

.. _JTAG Headers:

JTAG Headers
--------------

The BP-CC3301 was designed with 2 JTAG headers (J10, J11) for SWD interface with the XDS110 debug probe. The signal assignment for these headers are described in the figures and tables below.  

The main JTAG interface for the BP-CC3301 is via the LP-XDS110 (ET) that will be connected to the 20pin  header (J11).

.. _Power:

Power
======

The board is designed to accept power from a connected LaunchPad |trade| kit. Some LaunchPad kits cannot source the peak current requirements for Wi-Fi |trade| , which could be as high as 500 mA. In such cases, the USB connector (J7) on the BP-CC3301 can be used to aid in extra current. The use of Schottky diodes ensure that load sharing occurs between the USB connectors on the LaunchPad kit and the BoosterPack |trade| module without any board modifications. The jumpers labeled J6 (1.8v) and J8 (3.3v) can be used to measure the total current consumption of the board from the onboard LDO.

.. _Measure the CC3301 Current Draw:

Measure the CC3301 Current Draw
--------------------------------

Low Current Measurement (LPDS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To measure the current draw of the CC3301 device for both power supplies (3.3v or 1.8v), a jumper labeled J16 (for 3.3v supply) and a jumper labeled J15 (for 1.8v supply) is provided on the board. By removing J16, users can place an ammeter into this path to observe the current on the 3.3 V supply (see left side of :numref:`BP-CC3301_Ammeter` ) . The same process can be used for observing the current on the 1.8v supply with J15 (see right side of :numref:`BP-CC3301_Ammeter` ) . 
TI recommends this method for measuring the LPDS. 


.. _BP-CC3301_Ammeter:

.. figure:: resources/BP-CC3301_Ammeter.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50
    :alt: Ammeter

    Low Current measurement

Active Current Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To measure active current in a profile form, TI recommends using a 0.1 ohm 1% 0603 resistor on the board, and measuring the differential voltage across the resistor. This measurement can be done using a voltmeter or an oscilloscope for measuring the current profile for both power supplies (3.3 V or 1.8 V).
Jumper J15 is removed and a 0.01 resistor is populated in parallel to measure the active currents on the 1.8V supply (see left side of :numref:`BP-CC3301_Voltmeter`) . Similar operation with J16 and 3.3V supply (see right side of :numref:`BP-CC3301_Voltmeter`).

.. _Clocking:

Clocking
=========

The BP-CC3301 provides two clock inputs to the CC3301 device:

* Y1 is a 40 MHz crystal for fast clock input
* Y2 is a 32.768 kHz oscillator for slow clock input

If the user desires to provide their own external slow clock through the Slow Clock Input pin (refer to P2.19 seen on :numref:`BP_pinout`) some re-work must be performed. The 32.768 kHz oscillator (Y2) component should be removed, and a 0201 sized 0 ohm resistor should be populated on the footprint for R29, refer to :numref:`Rework-for-SlowClock` below.

.. _Rework-for-SlowClock:

.. figure:: resources/BP-CC3301_Clock_Rework.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50
    :alt: slow_clk

    Rework for use of external slow clock

.. hint::
  The slow clock can also be generated internally from the device, thus reducing system cost by removing the oscillator (Y2). The tradeoff of not having the oscillator is a degradation in power consumption when connected to an AccessPoint. 


CC3301 BoosterPack |trade| Hardware Setup
===========================================

.. _Performing_conducted_testing:

Performing Conducted Testing on BP-CC3301
-------------------------------------------

As seen in the figure below, the BP-CC3301 has an onboard SMA connector and chip antenna. The SMA connector (J1) provides a way for testing conducted measurements. Alternately, a trackpad for an UF.L connector (J2) is provided to replace the SMA connector and provide a second option for testing in the lab with a compatible cable (see right side of figure below). 

.. _RF_Path_on_BP-CC3301:

.. figure:: resources/BP-CC3301_RFpath.png
    :align: center
    :alt: RF_route
    :scale: 65

    RF Path on BP-CC3301

Rework may be needed before using the connector on J1/J2. This involves swapping the position of the existing 3.9 pF capacitor to lead the transmission line to the desired connection (see figure above).

.. _BP-CC3301 and LP-XDS110 setup:

Communication Setup for Radio Tool with LP-XDS110
--------------------------------------------------

The LP-XDS110 enables direct communication to the CC3301 device via the SWD interface. This allows external tools, such as Radio Tool from the SimpleLink |trade| Wi-Fi Toolbox (refer to `SimpleLink Wi-Fi Toolbox Startup Guide`_), to send commands directly to the device without the use of an embedded host.

To use the LP-XDS110 with the BP-CC3301 connect the 20-pin connector (J11) on the BP-CC3301 to the corresponding connector on the LP-XDS110 (see figure below). Make sure that the jumper on the LP-XDS110 (labeled TGT VDD) is in the EXT. configuration, shown in the figure below. This verifies that the target voltage for the JTAG signals are sourced from the BP-CC3301 (which is 1.8V) instead of the default LP-XDS110 target voltage (3.3V).

.. warning:: 
  Power supply for the BP-CC3301 comes from the LP-XDS110, but there can be usage scenarios where additional current is needed from the USB connection (J7). As such we recommend to provide external power from the USB connection (J7) for peak performance.

.. figure:: resources/LP-XDS110_toBP-CC3301.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 60

    BP-CC3301 connected to LP-XDS110

.. note::
  If there are problems with the computer recognizing the XDS110 DebugProbe, download and install the "XDS110 Support Utilities package" currently on release 7.0.100.1 from https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/xdsdebugprobes/emu_xds_software_package_download.html.
  
  
Setup for BP-CC3301 with MCU platform
-----------------------------------------------------
The BP-CC3301 can be used with a MCU running TCP/IP, like the `LP-AM243`_ . and can easily integrate with the LaunchPad by stacking the 40 pin headers, as shown in :numref:`MCU_platform` below .

.. _MCU_platform:

    :align: center
    :scale: 30

    BP-CC3301 stacked with LP-AM243

Setup for BP-CC3301 with MPU platform
-----------------------------------------------------

The BP-CC3301 can integrate with a host platform running Linux OS, like the `BeagleBone Black`_ (BBB). The BeagleBone Black is a low-cost, community-supported development platform as shown below.


.. figure::1_BeagleBoneBlack.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 30

    BeagleBone Black Board

To interface with the BP-CC3301 with the BeagleBone Black, the user also needs the `BP-CC33xx to BBB Adapter Board`_ 

.. figure:: resources/1-BeagleBoneBlack.png

If having issues with BeagleBoneBlack and BP-CC3301 make sure all boards are firmly pressed together to have best pin contact.

.. figure:: resources/3-BBB+BP-CC3301_sideView.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 40
    
    Side view of BP-CC3301 and BBB with adapter board



To make sure the BeagleBone Black boots up from the SD card, TI recommends to add a 100k Ohm resistor for R93 on the top of the BBB, and remove the R68 resistor seen on the bottom of the BBB. (see figures below).


.. figure:: resources/4-BBB_top_ECO.png
    :align: center

.. hint::
  Alternatively, the user can press and hold the SW2 button on the BeagleBone board during power up if the hardware modifications were not made. 

Lastly, adding a right angle header on the bottom of the BBB to easily connect the FTDI cable is optional. When the adapter board is attached to the BBB, the FTDI cable can get pinched between the BBB and adapter board, which can cause communication problems. (see figure below).
