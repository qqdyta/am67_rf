BLE Fundamentals
****************

The following sections will describe how to enable basic Bluetooth Low Energy use cases using the Linux BlueZ Bluetooth Stack.

The first step needed to take to either advertise or scan will be to enable BLE on the device 

Open a terminal and go to the following directory.

	.. code-block:: bash

		cd /usr/share/cc33xx

Next run the following script to enable BLE 

	.. code-block:: bash

		./ble_enable.sh

BLE should now be enabled on the Device
The next step is to get the hci0 interface is ready by running the following command.
	
	.. code-block:: bash

			hciconfig hci0 up


To make sure the interface is indeed up, call 

	.. code-block:: bash

			hciconfig -a

The interface should state UP RUNNING

**Advertising**
---------------

.. note::
	There are multiple Command Line utilities available to run BlueZ commands the common ones are hcitool, btmgmt, and bluetoothctl. They each have their own command sets 
	and can be used interchangebly to control the stack.

Before configuring the device to advertise we must first turn it off

	.. code-block:: bash

		btmgmt -i hci0 power off

Next run the following commands to configure the device to begin advertising

	.. code-block:: bash

		btmgmt -i hci0 le on

		btmgmt -i hci0 connectable on

		btmgmt -i hci0 bondable off

		btmgmt -i hci0 pairable off

		btmgmt -i hci0 privacy off

		btmgmt -i hci0 name cc33xxble

		btmgmt -i hci0 advertising on

This will set the device to start advertising with the local name set to "cc33xxble".
It also sets it to be connectable with low security.
Now we need to power the device once configured properly

	.. code-block:: bash
		
		btmgmt -i hci0 power on


**Scanning**
------------
Make sure the device BLE is up and running,

Open a terminal and run the following command

	.. code-block:: bash

		bluetoothctl

The utility will open with the menu. To start scanning run the following command.

	.. code-block:: bash

		scan on

The device will begin to scan. To turn off scanning, call

	.. code-block:: bash

		scan off

.. note::
	To set scan parameters (ex. duplicate filter) open the scan submenu by calling

	.. code-block:: bash

		menu scan

**Connecting and Pairing**
--------------------------
In order to connect and pair to a BLE Device you must register a pairing agent and know the Bluetooth Address (bdaddr) associated with the device you want to connect with.
This can be found by scanning for devices (as explained above).

You can register a pairing agent through the bluetoothctl utility
the mode selected will determine what authentication procedure.
	
	.. code-block:: bash

		DisplayOnly or DisplayYesNo : authentication by PIN/passkey code
		KeyboardOnly or KeyboardDisplay : yes/no choice to the pairing attempt
		NoInputNoOutput : no user confirmation

Open a terminal and run the following command

	.. code-block:: bash

		bluetoothctl

The utility will open with the menu. To choose the agent, run the following command.

	.. code-block:: bash

		agent {mode}

Once you have the bdaddr (from scanning) you can issue the following command to connect

	.. code-block:: bash

		pair {bdaddress}

.. note::
	An example of a valid bdaddr is C4:C1:A5:FB:6D:46

If the connection is successful a connection handle will be returned.
